# 🔨 Installation

Guild.so is based on Laravel 8 and Jetstream so you can run it just like a standard Laravel application. Here are 2 ways of running Guild.so:

## 💻 Local Installation

You will need to have the default requirements for a Laravel 8 application on your machine. Valet is a good solution to get you up and running quickly on your local server.

After your machine is setup for any Laravel application, you'll want to clone the repo into your sites folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guildso/guild
```

After cloning the repo to your machine we will want to create a new database for the application 👇

### Create a Database:

During the installation we need to use a MySQL database. You will need to create a local database and add the crendentials to your environment `.env` file.

### Update the environment `.env` file

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update your Database details in there:

```bash
APP_URL=http://guild.test

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=guild
DB_USERNAME=guild
DB_PASSWORD=guild_password
```

Great! next we'll need to install the composer dependencies.

### Composer Install

We need to include all our PHP vendor dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
composer install
```

### Migrate Database

Finally we'll want to run our database migrations with the following command.

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

> You may also need to run `php artisan key:generate` to generate a new key.

That's it! You should now be able to visit the application in your browser to setup your Company Info and User Account.  🎉

## 👨‍💻 Sample Data

If you wish to setup a sample application you may run `php artisan migrate:refresh --seed`. This will load the application with some sample data from the kick-ass sit-com **Silicon Valley** 👇

You may login with any user with the password: `password123`, example:

- **email**: richard[at]piedpiper.com
- **password**: password123

## 🤓 Development Tips

### Front-end Assets

In order to compile the front-end assets you'll want to install the node dependencies by running the following command in the root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

You can then run the following command to compile and watch for changes:

```bash
npm run watch
```

When you are ready to minify the assets and prepare it for production you will run:

```bash
npm run production
```

### Wallet Assets

The wallet javascript functionality has been separated into it's own asset watcher and builder in order to keep things simpler. You can find these assets located at `/public/wallet`.

You can install the node dependencies by running the following command in the `public/wallet` directory:

```bash
npm install
```

You can then compile the assets the same way as above 👆, by using the `npm run watch` and `npm run production` commands.

That's it for the development tips, but there will probably be more to come 😉
