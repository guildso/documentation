# ðŸ”¨ Installation

Guild.so is based on Laravel 8 and Jetstream so you can run it just like a standard Laravel application. Here are 2 ways of running Guild.so:


### Create a Database:

During the installation we need to use a MySQL database. You will need to create a new database and save the credentials for the next step.

### Update the `.env` file

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update your Database details in there:

```
APP_URL=http://guild.test

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=guild
DB_USERNAME=guild
DB_PASSWORD=guild_password
```

### Composer Install

```
composer install
```

### Install the NPM dependencies:

```
npm install && npm run dev
```

### Migrate Database

```
php artisan migrate
```
