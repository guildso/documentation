In this step you'll learn how to add your new token to your application.

## üéü Token Configuration

Integrating your token into the Guild application is super easy! All you need to do is to add the following information about your token at the end of your environment `.env` file:

```bash
SOLANA_TOKEN_NAME=GuildCoin
SOLANA_TOKEN_SYMBOL=GUILD
SOLANA_TOKEN_IMAGE=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thedevdojo/guild-coin/main/logo.png
SOLANA_TOKEN_ADDRESS=aLWmxJMu5naLLxMrvMN85AgUF9Fj7FXE9RS4MnwEouA
```

After you have added your token information to your environment file, you should be good to go and now your users can exchange points for your token.
